hsc ( v0.9.9,  09-Aug-1996 )

  This is a developer tool for html-projects.

  It can be used on any html-file and creates a new html-file
  as output. It's mainly intended to create and maintain larger
  html-projects. As a CLI-only tool, it can be used with `make'.

  hsc is *not* a tool to make html easier for beginners; It's a
  tool to make html a bit less painful and braindamaged for
  people who already know how to work with it.

  `hsc-source.lha')
