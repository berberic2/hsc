  hsc - html sucks completely

VERSION

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

  Hsc is a developer tool for html-projects.

  It can be used on any html file and creates a new html file as
  output. In the input file, you may use an extended syntax based on
  html, but which also allows extensions like macros, conditionals and
  more.

  It's mainly intended to create and maintain larger html projects. As
  a CLI-only tool, it can be used together with `make', and a
  dependency generator is included.

  Hsc is *not* a tool to make html easier for beginners; it's a tool
  to make html a bit less painful and brain-damaged for people who
  already know how to work with it.

FEATURES

  - macros (implemented as additional tags)
  - conditionals (if/else/elseif)
  - expressions, supporting
    - string concatenation and comparison
    - import of environment variables
    - current time
    - size of files
  - special tags to
    - include files (also verbatim text)
    - execute shell commands (and include output)
    - comment in a reasonable way
  - for local links, checks if file/id exists
  - project relative URIs
  - replaces special characters by entities
  - evaluates attributes for image size (PNG/jfif/gif)
  - can strip useless white space, comments and tags
  - replaces icon entities by images
  - performs a basic syntax- and structure check
  - error messages are easier to understand than the esoteric crap
    tools like sglms vommit
  - maintains a project file
  - includes hscpitt, a tool to examine/manipulate project files
  - includes hscdepp, a dependancy generator for makefiles

NEW FEATURES

  - added internal support for message browsers for AmigaOS and
    RiscOS
  - as usual some minor bugfixes and improvements

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  AmigaOS 2.04, 2MB of regular memory, 68020, some sort of w3-browser
  and ASCII editor.

  For larger projects, 4MB of memory and 68060 are recommended.

  Different to many other html-tools, hsc requires a user-IQ > 50. You
  should also know how to work with the CLI and how to write
  Makefiles. You should already have made some experiences with macro
  processors and some programming language (Rexx should suffice).
