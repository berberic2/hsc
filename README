DESCRIPTION

  hsc is a developer tool for html projects.

  It can be used on any html file and creates a new html file as
  output. In the input file, you may use an extended syntax based
  on html, but which also allows things like macros and
  conditionals.

  It's mainly intended to create and maintain larger html projects.
  As a CLI-only tool, it should be used with `make'; a 
  dependecy generator is included.

  hsc is *not* a tool to make html easier for beginners; It's a
  tool to make html a bit less painful and braindamaged for
  people who already know how to work with it.

FEATURES

  o adds some special tags, for example to
    o include files (also sources)
    o execute shell commands during conversion
    o add comments in a reasonable way
  o supports macros (implemented as additional tags)
  o conditionals (if/else/elseif)
  o simple expressions can be passed as values to attributes (like
    string concatenation, string comparison, import of environment-
    variables, current time or filesize)
  o for local links, checks if file/id exists
  o maintains a project-file to check existence of id's over all 
    files processed
  o supports absolute URIs (relative to root directory of project)
  o replaces special characters by entities
  o evaluates attributes for image size
  o strips comments and specified tags
  o strips useless white spaces
  o replaces icon entities by images

  o easy to extend syntax-definition format
