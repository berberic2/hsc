     The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and
     ordinary characters.  All ordinary characters are copied directly into
     the buffer.  A conversion specification consists of a percent sign
     ```%''' and one other character.

     No more than maxsize characters will be placed into the array.  If the
     total number of resulting characters, including the terminating null
     character, is not more than maxsize, strftime() returns the number of
     characters in the array, not counting the terminating null.  Otherwise,
     zero is returned.

     Each conversion specification is replaced by the characters as follows
     which are then copied into the buffer.
