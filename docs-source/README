docs source directory
=====================

This directory contains the hsc-sources for the documentation.

They have been included to provide a rather complex example. Feel free
to examine the sources and the Makefile.

For some binary distributions (AmigaOS, RiscOS), you might only find
this README. Please refer to "hsc/README" (see parent directory) where
you can obtain the sources from.
