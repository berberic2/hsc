<P>One of the most annoying thing within creating HTML-pages is to
find out if all your links work.</P>

<P>For local links, <hsc> checks existence of URIs in you HTML-project.
When you refer to a non-existing local link within your source, <hsc>
will display a warning message.</P>

<P>(To suppress this message, use the <op_ignore>-option)</P>
