Hmpf... Grmbl... Wrcks...
=========================

This file is of no use for new users of hsc and just describes the
in-combat-ibilities of this release to the previous one. For a 
complete list of improvements and bugfixes, refer to "CHANGES".

For users of hsc 0.9.9
----------------------

- The old if-syntax is no more supported.
- Plain 68000-CPUs are no more supported; at least a 68020 is
  required now. Flame me, if this is a problem for you, but I
  don't think hsc is usefull on a plain 68k, and a single 
  binary makes the archive significantly smaller.

For users of hsc 0.9.10pr*
--------------------------

- CLI-option QUOTEMODE has been renamed to QUOTESTYLE
- Unix-version now (again) returns "0" if only warnings occured

For those who want to compile hsc
---------------------------------

- OLDIFCOND is no more supported

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Below you can find the "Hmpf_Grmbl_Wrcks" for hsc 0.9.8, just for the
case you missed this release during the summer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hmpf... Grmbl... Wrcks... (for hsc 0.9.8)
=========================================

For those who want to compile hsc
---------------------------------

- Please read the "source/README" to avoid problems.

- There is only one Makefile neccessary now.
  "ugly/Makefile" is no more shipped with the archive.

- The new Makefile uses some features of GNUmake, but
  there is another "Makefile.dodl" which will be easier
  to use for those who got stuck to CC and some
  prehistoric wannabe-make

- If you define OLDIFCOND when compiling hsc, it will be able
  to handle both styles of <$if>, altought in a rather dirty
  way. See also below.

For users of hsc 0.9.9pr2
-------------------------

- The (undocument) option URISTYLE has been removed, it's
  functionallity now works without it.

- Some names for attributes have changed even since
  hsc 0.9.9pr2.

- The tagline hscdepp uses in Makefiles has changed.

For users of hsc 0.9.8
----------------------

- The C-like names for most special attributes have been
  renamed from `__xxx__' to `HSC.xxx'. As I hate everything
  that reminds me to C, this really has been necessary.

- The argument-sequence to specify include-files has
  changed. Instead of

    hsc file.hsc inc1.hsc inc2.hsc

  you now have to use

    hsc inc1.hsc inc2.hsc file.hsc

  But before you are going to update your Makefiles, check 
  the docs, section "Project Managment". You probably will 
  want to use a new Makefile anyway.

- Special tag <$insert> has become obsolete. At the moment,
  it still is there, but you should use GETTIME() (see Docs:
  "Expression") and <(...)> instead. It will be removed at 
  all with one of the next releases.

- <$if> now has become a `normal' html-like-tag with a single
  attribute `COND' (short for `condition'). As this is a
  really nasty change, the old syntax is still supported,
  altough using a nasty hack.

- If you insert temporary files using <$include>, problems
  might occure if you also utilize the project-file and the
  new `hscdepp'; there's a new attribute TEMPORARY for
  <$insert> to avoid this, read to docs for details.

- <$exec> has become more powerful; basically, old calls to
  this tag should still work, but problems might occure if
  you redirect the output. Read the docs for details.

- Warning #51 has been removed. Quotes can now be replaced
  using the CLI-option "RPLCQUOTE", this task is no more
  performed by "SMARTENT".

- CLI-option PIPEIN does no more exist, instead use
  FROM=STDIN as filename. Note that STDIN is case-sensive
  in this case, even for the AmigaOS-version.

- hsc uses a new format for the project-file, but still can
  read the old one. But older versions of hsc won't be able to
  read the new one.

- hsc now uses a new sequence of  directories trying to find
  "hsc.prefs"; first, it will look at the current directory,
  after that scan the value of HSCPREFS. Then, for AmigaOS:
  "env:", "s:", for Unix: "/usr/local/lib/"; note that "~/"
  is no more supported because this caused problems on some
  systems (I don't know and even don't care why).
