Hmpf... Grmbl... Wrcks...
=========================

This file is of no use for new users of hsc and just describes the
in-combat-ibilities of this release to the previous one. For a 
complete list of improvements and bugfixes, refer to "CHANGES".

- Looking for "hsc.prefs" now uses: current dir, $HSCPATH, PROGDIR:;
  The directories s: and env: are no more scanned.

- Installation has changed a bit (see Docs). It is now suggested to
  keep the whole hsc directory in one piece.

- ICONBASE now requires a "*" as a substitute for the icon name

- Source archive now extracts to "hsc/source/" (before: "source/")
