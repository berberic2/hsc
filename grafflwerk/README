About `grafflwerk'
==================

This drawer contains some files and material that can be useful in
combination with hsc. Do with it whatever you want, use at your own
risk.

The ARexx-scripts for ScMsg are a bit experimental because I don't
like ScMsg and don't use these scripts myself.

The Arexx-script for AWeb should be easy to change for other
Browsers because it isn't very complex.

Makefile
--------
This is an empty Makefile you can use as initial for new projects.
Read the docs, section "Project Mangament" to find out how it is
supposed to work.

hScMsg.rexx
-----------
An ARexx-script that invokes hsc redirecting it's messages and sends
messages outputed by hsc to ScMsg, which is part of the
SAS/c-package. It is supposed to be used as a substitute for hsc
inside Makefiles. See the source-code for usage.

SendAWeb.rexx
-------------
An ARexx-script that can be used to display an updated html-object
in AWeb. Read the docs, section
"project managment/makefiles/postprocessing" for details.

SendScMsg.rexx
--------------
An ARexx-script that sends messages outputed by hsc to ScMsg, which
is part of the SAS/c-package. See the source-code for usage.
