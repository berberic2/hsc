Example Project
===============

This directory contains a small example project.

The sources are collected in "source_hsc/" and should be converted to
"object_html/". This is the directory where the "browsable" data
will be located.

This text asumes that your current directory is
"[hsc]/example/source_hsc/".

Description of sources:
-----------------------

main.hsc              the project's intros page
stupid.hsc            a simple page that can be reached from "main"
macro.hsc             contains some macro definitions and is
                      included into all files
hugo/                 a subdirectory, where all information about
                      Hugo is collected
hugo/hugo.hsc         some information about Hugo
hugo/hugo.gif         a picture of Hugo

Setting up the object directory:
--------------------------------

For every directory in the source-dir, a corresponding directory
with the same name has to be created. This can be done via

    makedir /object_html/hugo                    ; AmigaOS
    mkdir   ../object_html/hugo                  ; Unix

As the picture is of no real use in the source-dir, you should move
it to the object-dir:

    rename hugo/hugo.gif /object_html/hugo/      ; AmigaOS
    mv hugo/hugo.gif ../object_html/hugo/        ; Unix

Note that every file, that is not a hsc-source or include-file has
to be located somewhere in the object-dir. This especially concerns
pictures, sounds and everything else that is linked, but not a
hsc-source.

Starting the conversion:
------------------------

Now you are ready to start `make':

    make

Of course, you need to have a `make' command installed in your search
path. For AmigaOS, search "aminet:dev/*" for fitting a program.

After that, all html-objects in "object_html/" should be ready.

Note that there does not exist a "macro.html", because the there was
no rule for this in the makefile. There is no rule neccessary,
because "macro.hsc" is never converted alone, but only included by
the other files. Additionally, "macro.hsc" contains no readable text
or tags.

Take a look at the "Makefile" to understand the basic concept of hsc.
