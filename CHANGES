                   ===================

Version 0.9.3,  20-Nov-1995 (internal release only)
 - added special values for IGNORE
 - added PRE option for <$INCLUDE>
 - added <$SOURCE> to support inline sources
 - added tag <$LET> to create/update attributes
 - added tag <$MESSAGE> for user messages
 - container usage of <P> and <LI> is now supported
   (altough, in a quite clumsy way; see AUTOCLOSE)
 - writes output only if no error occured
 - improved handling of comments inside macros
 - improved speed for reading macros
 - fixed bug: values for attributes of a tag have not
   been reset before processing it
 - fixed bug within nested <$ELSE>
 - fixed bug: <BASE> called handler for <Hx>
 - fixed bug: trailing white spaces of a file have
   not been processed
 - buffer for <$INSERT TIME> automatically expands
   to required size (before: limited to 40 chars)

Version 0.9.2, 23-Oct-1995
 - improved docs
 - changed concept for absolute URIs: switch ABSURI
   does no more exist, abs. URIs now start with ":"
   and can be mixed with relative URIs (suggested
   by Arno Hollosi)
 - <$IF>..<$ELSE>..</$IF> for conditional conversion
 - <$EXEC COMMAND=".."> to start shell commands
 - added SOURCE option for <$INCLUDE>
 - closing macro now not only inherits attributes
   passed to the opening macro, but also its values
   (kick me for that!)
 - check for redefinance of tag/macro
 - writing to output starts after useful data
   (skip empty lines, white-spaces, comments and
   hsc-tags in config/include files)
 - removed bug in handler for SGML comments, if "\n"
   was found inside comment
 - Zero-SGML comments now work ( "<!>" only)
 - support JERK-attributes
 - more information displayed if unexpected end of
   file reached
 - removed enforcer-hit when writing to stdout
 - several minor bugs fixed
 - speed up for dynamic string handling
 - not compiled with gcc 2.6.3; compiled with a friend's
   sas/c because I got silly enforcer hits when compiling
   with gcc; even more strange, they only occure with
   Amiga-version of gcc; compiling hsc under Linux or
   FreeBSD (x86) causes no problems; I really should get
   gcc 2.7.0 for my Amiga..

Version 0.9.1,  9-Oct-1995
 - featuring "hsc.prefs"! (Gott, lass Hirn vom Himmel fallen)
 - improved docs (a bit)
 - removed loads of typos
 - writing output to stdout if no filename or
   destination directory passed
 - writing to output starts after first non-hsc-tag
   (skip empty lines and white-spaces in config)
 - replaced <$INSERT TEXT STRING=".."> by
   <$INSERT TEXT="..">
 - improved handler for SGML comments (and "!"-tags)
 - support numeric entities (eg "&#123;")
 - "quot" entity
 - whines about quotes found within text
 - replace "&","<",">" by its entities, if surounded
   by white-spaces (switch SMARTENT)
 - replace quotes by "&quot;" (switch SMARTENT)
 - added "Reading config" status message
 - still compiled with gcc 2.6.3

Version 0.9,   4-Oct-1995 (first public release)
 - still compiled with gcc 2.6.3
