                   ===================

Version 0.9.7, 15-May-1996
 - fixed a nasty bug that could cause enforcer-hits
   inside macros
 - fixed bug: for GETSIZE within GIFs, now the size
   of the first image is used (before: size of screen)
 - MAJOR CHANGE:
   - changed CLI option TO that it requires keyword `TO'
     and decides if TO decribes a directory or file
     depending on the last character (check for `/').
   - removed CLI option INCLUDE; now you have to pass
     only the filename with no preceeding keyword
   - declaration of an enumerator-type now supports
     expressions as argument.
 - renamed CLI option ERRFILE to MSGFILE ('cause not all
   messages are errors..)
 - removed CLI option CHECKURI; now use IGNORE=21 if you
   don't want your URIs to be checked for existence
 - added CLI option MSGFORMAT to describe output format
   of messages
 - added useful file location for messages within macros
 - changed message for missing end tags that it now
   reports location of corresponding start tag
 - added check for existence of IDs inside same file
 - added CLI option PRJFILE for project-file that
   maintains data about IDs globaly
 - added check for existence of IDs inside same file
 - added check for existence of IDs for all files
   included into project file
 - added attribute types `ID' and `COLOR'
 - added tag "<(..)>" to insert values of expressions
 - added JFIF/JPEG-support for GETSIZE
 - added support for some html3-tags within "hsc.prefs"
 - added new message type "portability problem"
 - added def's for most proposed html30-tags
 - removed string-arrays for parsing & checking URIs;
   there should be no more "normal" C-strings within
   the whole source now (exept some message buffers,
   which get truncated if too small)
 - now compiles fine with gcc's "-Wall -W"-options
   (exept some warnings about unused variables/functions)
 - using that stupid AmigaGuide-like buttons for the
   navigation bar within the docs
 - compiled with gcc 2.7.0 and libnix 1.1

Version 0.9.6, 12-Jan-1996
 - fixed bug: white spaces after boolean attributes
   have been stripped, if no expression followed
 - fixed bug: "click-here" checking has only been
   done, if RPLCENT has been set
 - MAJOR CHANGE: improved concept for attributes:
   - added tag <$DEFINE> to create new attributes
   - changed <$LET> to only update already existing
     attributes
   - changed syntax to define an attribute: flags
     now must come before default value; this
     stricter syntax seems to be more consistent, if
     you use a "/" in the default value, but didn't
     enclose it into quotes
   - added attribute flags /GLOBAL, /CONST, /GETSIZE
     and /STRIPEXT
   - removed attribute flags /NOQUOTE, /NOCOPY and
     /NOHANDLE (they've been undocumented anyway)
 - added COMPACT option to strip useless linefeeds
   and white spaces
 - added QUOTEMODE option to use same kind of quotes
   for all attributes
 - added STRIPEXTERNAL option to strip tags that
   contain a reference to an external URI
 - added STRIPCOMMENT to strip SGML comments
 - added STRIPTAGS to strip specific tags
 - added support for linefeeds inside expressions
 - added support for linefeeds inside strings
 - Amiga version now also searches "env:" for prefs
 - added more subtile STATUS option
 - status message string is no more done via
   sprintf() and is stripped if it gets too long
 - added some plausibility checking for <$DEFENT>
 - rewrote ReadMe for example-project
 - fixed dead links in docs (used IGNORE=21 when
   converting docs..)

Version 0.9.5, 21-Dec-1995
 - included source into distribution
 - example project now compiles again (Hmpf..)
 - added boolean expressions
 - added default values for boolean attributes
 - added GETENV operator to import values of
   environment variables

Version 0.9.4, 14-Dec-1995
 - distributing archive under GNU General public
   license (read "GNU_GPL" for details)
 - renamed "hsc.html" to "index.html" (docs)
 - MAJOR CHANGE: introducing new concept for
   handling of arguments to attributes (see
   docs, chapter "Expressions"); references to
   other attributes MUST NOT be enclosed in "<"
   and ">" anymore.
 - added message for "click here" syndrome
 - added global attribute "__CLICK_HERE__" for
   keywords that should envoke a "click here"
   warning if found in anchor text.
 - added global attribute "__SYSTEM__", that
   contains an ID for the used operating system.
 - fixed bug: using an end tag for a non-container
   caused enforcer hit
 - fixed bug that lead to wrong file positions in
   error messages after some line-feeds
 - several minor bugs fixed

Version 0.9.3,  20-Nov-1995 (internal release only)
 - added special values for IGNORE
 - added PRE option for <$INCLUDE>
 - added <$SOURCE> to support inline sources
 - added tag <$LET> to create/update attributes
 - added tag <$MESSAGE> for user messages
 - container usage of <P> and <LI> is now supported
   (altough, in a quite clumsy way; see AUTOCLOSE)
 - writes output only if no error occured
 - improved handling of comments inside macros
 - improved speed for reading macros
 - fixed bug: values for attributes of a tag have not
   been reset before processing it
 - fixed bug within nested <$ELSE>
 - fixed bug: <BASE> called handler for <Hx>
 - fixed bug: trailing white spaces of a file have
   not been processed
 - buffer for <$INSERT TIME> automatically expands
   to required size (before: limited to 40 chars)

Version 0.9.2, 23-Oct-1995
 - improved docs
 - changed concept for absolute URIs: switch ABSURI
   does no more exist, abs. URIs now start with ":"
   and can be mixed with relative URIs (suggested
   by Arno Hollosi)
 - <$IF>..<$ELSE>..</$IF> for conditional conversion
 - <$EXEC COMMAND=".."> to start shell commands
 - added SOURCE option for <$INCLUDE>
 - closing macro now not only inherits attributes
   passed to the opening macro, but also its values
   (kick me for that!)
 - check for redefinance of tag/macro
 - writing to output starts after useful data
   (skip empty lines, white-spaces, comments and
   hsc-tags in config/include files)
 - removed bug in handler for SGML comments, if "\n"
   was found inside comment
 - Zero-SGML comments now work ( "<!>" only)
 - support JERK-attributes
 - more information displayed if unexpected end of
   file reached
 - removed enforcer-hit when writing to stdout
 - several minor bugs fixed
 - speed up for dynamic string handling
 - not compiled with gcc 2.6.3; compiled with a friend's
   sas/c because I got silly enforcer hits when compiling
   with gcc; even more strange, they only occure with
   Amiga-version of gcc; compiling hsc under Linux or
   FreeBSD (x86) causes no problems; I really should get
   gcc 2.7.0 for my Amiga..

Version 0.9.1,  9-Oct-1995
 - featuring "hsc.prefs"! (Gott, lass Hirn vom Himmel fallen)
 - improved docs (a bit)
 - removed loads of typos
 - writing output to stdout if no filename or
   destination directory passed
 - writing to output starts after first non-hsc-tag
   (skip empty lines and white-spaces in config)
 - replaced <$INSERT TEXT STRING=".."> by
   <$INSERT TEXT="..">
 - improved handler for SGML comments (and "!"-tags)
 - support numeric entities (eg "&#123;")
 - "quot" entity
 - whines about quotes found within text
 - replace "&","<",">" by its entities, if surounded
   by white-spaces (switch SMARTENT)
 - replace quotes by "&quot;" (switch SMARTENT)
 - added "Reading config" status message
 - still compiled with gcc 2.6.3

Version 0.9,   4-Oct-1995 (first public release)
 - still compiled with gcc 2.6.3
