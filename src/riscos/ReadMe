Preparing the sources for compilation
=====================================

The sources of hsc come in Unix filename conventions (ie. '/c' and '/h'
extensions) so you need to convert them to RISC OS format (ie. directories
'c', 'h' and 'o'). The RunMe1st Obey file does this automatically, it scans
all the source directory, renames the files accordingly and creates the 'o'
directories where needed. It also sets the filetype of MakeStubs (see below)
and copies the Makefile from the 'riscos' directory to the upper directory
from where you can run it.

Note that you need a filing system that supports names longer than 10
characters in order to compile hsc (eg. use LongFiles on FileCore discs or
an image filing system such as X-Files or SparkFS). Actually names longer
than 10 characters are only present before the files are moved to the 'c' and
'h' directories, once you have executed the RunMe1st file you can copy the
sources to any filing system.


Making o.UnixStubs
==================

You will need to make o.UnixStubs before you can compile this program.  This
is a patched SharedCLibrary.


Semi-Automatic
--------------

Copy your Cv5 o.Stubs from their normal place into the o directory as
UnixStubs.

Show the Filer the !Patch application (comes with all versions of RISCOS)

Double click on the MakeStubs patch file.

Drag o.UnixStubs onto Patch, tick the patch and then choose to patch all
from the menu.


Manual
------

Copy your Cv5 o.Stubs from their normal place into the o directory as
UnixStubs.

Load it into a text editor.

Change the occurrence of
  fopen   --> gopen
  freopen --> greopen
  rename  --> gename
  remove  --> gemove

Save the file.  Note that you shouldn't have made the file any longer in the
process and you should only have changed 4 bytes.


Compiling the sources
=====================

Just set the CSD in the 'source' directory and execute 'amu' or double click
the Makefile. At the end of the compilation you'll find the three executables
'hsc', 'hscdepp' and 'hscpitt' in the main hsc directory (ie. one level above
'source').

Currently only the Acorn C V5 compiler has been tested but probably also
Acorn C V4 will be able to compile hsc.
