                    hsc source distribution
                    =======================

This archive contains the sources for hsc. They are distributed under
GNU General Public License (for details, see file "GNU_GPL" in this
directory).

To compile it, change the makefiles according to your system/compiler,
and comment out sections not required by adding a "#" at the
beginning of the specific lines.

At the moment, only AmigaOS and Unix are supported. For AmigaOS, you
require SAS/C or gcc, for Unix, only gcc is supported; But as the
makefile does not use any very special options of gcc, most cc-like
compilers also should work after replacing "gcc" by eg "cc" (know
to work with SGIs).

The makefiles support three compilation modes: "debug" for a
debugging version that includes all debugging information, supports
a source-level memory-tracking and enables some additional output
and plausibility checks. "norm" links only some debugging information,
and "optim" strips all debugging information and creates an optimized
executable; with some compilers, "optim" migth cause problems.

Make sure that you compile the "ugly" files and the main files with
the same mode.

Problems might occure, if your compiler does not support ANSI-C
(as "cc" under SunOS on my university - Pfthuahuhahua!)


Change to the directory "ugly/" and compile the files there
(This is my own personal function library - experimental stuff).

After that, compile the other files using the makefile in the
main-directory.

Command sequence:

    cd ugly
    make      (or "smake" for SAS/C)
    cd ..     (or "/" for AmigaOS without c-shell)
    make

If nothing went wrong, you now should have created a file called
"hsc" which is the executable. Now follow the installation
instructions of the documentation that came with the main-archive.
