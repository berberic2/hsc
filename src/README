hsc source archive
==================

This archive contains the sources for hsc. They are distributed under
GNU General Public License (for details, see file "COPYING" in this
directory).

IMPORTANT: If you've compiled older versions of hsc before, remove 
all files of the old sources before you continue.

There are two makefiles:

"Makefile.dodl" is designed to compile with CC under an Unix-esh 
environment without any special options or debugging-features enabled.

"Makefile", which uses conditionals for figuring out the compiler and
environment, 

At the moment, only AmigaOS and Unix are supported. For AmigaOS, you
require GCC or SAS/c, for Unix,  GCC and CC are supported.

This makefile supports three compilation modes: "debug" for a
debugging version that includes all debugging information, supports
a source-level memory-tracking and enables some additional output
and plausibility checks. "norm" links only some debugging information,
and "optim" strips all debugging information and creates an optimized
executable; with some compilers, "optim" migth cause problems.

Normally, no warnings should show up, expect about ununsed functions
and parameters. This is because some parameters and functions are
only used by the debugging-version.

Problems might occure, if your compiler does not support ANSI-C
(as "cc" under SunOS on my university - Pfthuahuhahua!), but I won't
care about this.

If nothing went wrong, you now should have created two files called
"hsc/hsc" and "hscdepp/hscdepp" which are the executables. Now follow
the installation instructions of the documentation that came with the 
main-archive.
