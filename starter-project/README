About `starter-project'
=======================

Amiga users, ignore this material and double-click "hsc-Tschak". This
will spare you the CLI-crap below.

For all others: this drawer contains some files and material that can
be used as a template for new projects. Included are a Makefile, a
first hsc source called "welcome.html" and a directory containing
include files you want to use for every new project.

You can start a new project by copying the directory contents to the
location where you want to start you new project.

To for example setup a new project in "work:web/dogstuff" with the
source code located in "work:web/dogstuff/source", do the following:

- "cd" to work:web/dogstuff/source
- copy the contents of starter-project to it, so you should then have
  a "work:web/dogstuff/source/welcome.hsc"
- edit the Makefile, set DESTDIR to "/" (or "../" on various other
  systems)
- invoke "hscpitt new"
- invoke "hscpitt add /welcome.html welcome.hsc"
- invoke "make depend"
- invoke "make" to create "work:web/dogstuff/welcome.html"

Then you can view the document in "work:web/dogstuff/welcome.html"
