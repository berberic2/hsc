About `starter-project'
=======================

This drawer contains some files and material that can be used as a
template for new projects. Included are a makefile, a (nearly) empty
project file and the first hsc/html file.

source/
-------
This drawer contains the source file for your project

source/Makefile
---------------
This is an empty Makefile you can use as initial for new projects.
Read the docs, section "Project Mangament" to find out how it is
supposed to work.

html/
-----
This is a destination directory, where all documents created from
the source will be placed. Also all your additional data like
images or archives accessable from your pages should end up there.
