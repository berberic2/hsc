This file is of no use for new users of hsc and just describes the
in-combat-ibilities of this release to the previous one. For a 
complete list of improvements and bug-fixes, refer to `CHANGES'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.915

- For those who need to compile everything on there own: the whole
  process has changed a bit, the Makefile should now be easier to
  handle. Compiling is no more described in `source/README', but in
  `docs/source.html'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.914

- The `examples' drawer is back again.

- The documentation now tells a bit more about `make'; If this still
  does not help to prevent new users from sending me bullshit-emails
  with extraordinary silly questions, I might consider removing the
  introductory material completely...

- The term `absolute URI' is now used for external URIs; the manual
  now referres to `project relative URIs' instead to avoid confusion
  as this term is normally used to refer to external URIs...clear?
  Better give "docs/features/uris.html" a glimpse...

- If you compile this yourself and perform a `make test' afterwards,
  some calls to hsc will exit with an error return code. This is
  because some test sources now contain corrupt data. These will not
  create a html document, bug only a message file which will be
  analysed for differences just like before. The `diff' program still
  should not report any mismatches, of course.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.913

This isn't really a nasty update, but:

- Container macros are now implemented in a cleaner way. However,
  old-style containers still work, and currently there is no need to
  remove this code. Although old-style is not documented any more.

  Anyway, instead of

    <$macro FILE><I><$macro>
    <$macro /FILE></I><$macro>

  you should now use

    <$macro FILE /CLOSE><I><$content></I><$macro>

  when creating new macros.

- to check existence of files, there are now two functions: Exists()
  works on URIs, and fExists() on files relative to the source
  directory

- collected some material from `graffelwerk' and `example' and put it
  into `starter-project', which should now contain a reasonable
  template to start with a new project.

- the hsc-sources for the docs are now located in the source-archive

- hscpalthrow introduces the first tool of the hsc-package *not*
  named after a male actor, but a female one. Therefor, certain
  homo-erotic aspects of this package will probably vanish.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.912

- "hsc.prefs" has be changed so that <HTML>, <HEAD> and <BODY> are
  no more required, but only recommended within a document.

- The Makefile for the source archive now supports library managers
  like `ar' and `oml'
