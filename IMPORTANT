IMPORTANT
=========

For a short general information, read `README'.

For a complete list of fixes and improvements, read `CHANGES'.

To read the docs, start Your w3-browser and open the file
`docs/index.html'.

Users of previous versions should read `Hmpf_Grmbl_Wrcks' which
tells you how to cope with incompatibilities. If this document does
not exist, there has been nothing remarkable about this release.

If you want to compile hsc yourself, read `source/README'. This
document is not included in the AmigaOS-binary-archive, you will
need to download `hsc-source.lha' from the same site you've got the
binaries from.
