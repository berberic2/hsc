Simple Example Project
======================

This directory contains a small example project.

The sources are collected in "source_hsc/" and should be converted to
"object_html/". This is the directory where the "browsable" data
will be located.

This text assumes that you are in the CLI and your current directory
is "[hsc]/examples/simple/source_hsc/", with "[hsc]" being the
directory where you installed this package to.

Description of sources:
-----------------------

main.hsc              the welcome page of this project
stupid.hsc            a simple page that can be reached from "main"
macro.hsc             contains some macro definitions and is
                      included into all files
hugo/                 a subdirectory, where all information about
                      Hugo is collected
hugo/hugo.hsc         some information about Hugo
hugo/hugo.gif         a picture of Hugo

Setting up the object directory:
--------------------------------

For every directory in the source-dir, a corresponding directory
with the same name has to be created. This can be done via

    makedir /object_html/hugo

As the picture is of no real use in the source directory, you should
move it to the object directory:

    rename hugo/hugo.gif /object_html/hugo/

Note that every file, that is not a hsc-source or include-file has to
be located somewhere in the object directory. This especially concerns
pictures, sounds and everything else that is linked, but not a hsc
source file.

Starting the conversion:
------------------------

Now you are ready to start `make':

    make

Of course, you need to have a `make' command installed in your search
path. See the main documentation where to obtain it.

After that, all html-objects in "object_html/" should be ready.

Note that there does not exist a "macro.html", because the there is
no rule for this in the makefile. There is no rule necessary,
because "macro.hsc" is never converted alone, but only included by
the other files. Additionally, "macro.hsc" contains no readable text
or tags.

Take a look at the "Makefile" to understand the basic concept of hsc.

Toubleshooting:
---------------

If make aborts with a message like

   *** unable to open `/object_html/hugo/hugo.html' for output:
       No such file or directory

you forgot the call to `makedir' mentioned above.

If make aborts with a message like

   Makefile:31: *** missing separator.  Stop.

you are using a editor which replaces TABs by normal blanks. This is a
good time to start browsing the documantation, section `Project
Management/Make'...
