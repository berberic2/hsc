Fetzenschädl Example Project
============================

This directory contains a small example project.

It will result in exactly the same pages as those you can find in
`examples/simple'. However there is a remarkable difference: Both the
html documents and the hsc sources are located in the same directory
tree.

This has mostly disadvantages:

- Your hsc sources will waste space on the w3-server disk.
- When processing, hsc will have to access the disk of your
  w3-server, resulting in an increased load.
- Unless you set decent access rights of your hsc sources, they can
  be loaded into a w3-browser just like normal html documents.
- Objects and sources are not separated from each other, which will
  make certain operations (like archiving) more difficult.

But there also is an advantage: During the first steps, it might be
easier for new users to cope with this approach, as they will not have
to mess around with the numerous options of hsc to specify the output.

However, you should not design projects this way because of the above
mentioned reasons. Refer to `examples/simple' for a more reasonable
way to achieve the same results.

Description of sources:
-----------------------

main.hsc              the welcome page of this project
stupid.hsc            a simple page which can be reached from "main"
macro.hsc             contains some macro definitions and is
                      included into all files
hugo/                 a subdirectory, where all information about
                      Hugo is collected
hugo/hugo.hsc         some information about Hugo
hugo/hugo.gif         a picture of Hugo

Starting the conversion:
------------------------

This text assumes that you are in the CLI and your current directory
is "[hsc]/examples/fetzenschaedl/", with "[hsc]" being the directory
where you installed this package to.

Now you are ready to start `make':

    make

Of course, you need to have a `make' command installed in your search
path. See the main documentation where to obtain it.

After that, all html-objects should be ready. You can start browsing
them by loading `main.html' into your browser.

Note that there does not exist a "macro.html", because the there is
no rule for this in the makefile. There is no rule necessary,
because "macro.hsc" is never converted alone, but only included by
the other files. Additionally, "macro.hsc" contains no readable text
or tags.

Take a look at the "Makefile" to understand the basic concept of hsc.
